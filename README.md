This is an assignment from The Odin Project's Web Development 101 course for HTML/CSS to replicate Google's homepage.

Short Completion Reflection;
Replicated the Google homepage to my current best ability.
Still unsure of how to implement the magnifying glass search icon and the "apps" icon on the top navigation bar.

Had to inspect elements of the Google main page often as I am still unsure of many of the elements to use in HTML and CSS. 

Lines of codes looks really messy. Will improve on that to write cleaner and neater codes.

Will improve more on HTML and CSS.
